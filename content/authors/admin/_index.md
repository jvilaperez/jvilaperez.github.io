I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT, where I work with Prof. Peraire and Dr. Nguyen. My research deals with the development of numerical methods and their integration to space weather applications.

More broadly, my research covers a diverse array of topics, including the study of the upper atmosphere, compressible aerodynamics and, more broadly, the development of low and high-order computational methods, spanning from finite volume schemes to high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods.
Before joining MIT, I earned my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, in Barcelona, in 2021, focusing on low and high-order hybridized methods for compressible flows. I received my Bachelor‚Äôs double degree in Mathematics and Aerospace Engineering, and a Master in Applied Mathematics from the same university in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
